3) Main Frame
    The main function contains a loop:
        1) read line from the stdin
        2) parse the line, fill them in the command array, and acquire whether it is a background job or not.
            each command contains the necessary parameters and redirect input or output file
        3) if parsing is successful, execute the entire commands
            check whether the commands are built-in command or not: set, cd, exit, quit, jobs.
            check whether the commands should be in background or not. If in background, a child process should be generated.
            generate a single child process for every single command, and build up the pipe between every process.
            read redirect  for the first command if necessary
            write redirect for the last commands if necessary
